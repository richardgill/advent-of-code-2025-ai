Similar to reading ASCII art representations or parsing tables.\n\n2. **Column-based Data Extraction** - Reading data vertically from columns rather than horizontally from rows. This appears in problems involving rotated or transposed data.\n\n3. **Delimiter-based Grouping** - Identifying groups separated by empty columns/rows. Similar to parsing paragraph-separated text or finding connected components.\n\n### Problem Classification\n\nThis problem belongs to the class of **2D grid parsing with custom interpretation**:\n- Part 1: Traditional row-based number extraction, where each row contributes one number per problem\n- Part 2: Column-based number extraction, where each column contributes one number (digits read top-to-bottom)\n\n### Solution Approach\n\n**Part 1**: \n- Parse the grid into rows\n- Identify problem boundaries by finding all-space columns\n- For each problem, extract numbers from rows by reading the characters in each column range\n- Apply the operator and sum results\n\n**Part 2**: \n- Same grid parsing\n- Process columns right-to-left instead of left-to-right\n- Each column becomes a number (digits concatenated top-to-bottom)\n- The twist was understanding that 'cephalopod math' means each column is a complete number, not each row\n\nThe key insight for Part 2 was recognizing that the interpretation of the grid completely changes - instead of numbers spanning multiple columns horizontally, each column IS a number read vertically. This required restructuring the extraction logic from 'collect characters from columns into row-numbers' to 'collect characters from rows into column-numbers'.\"","description":"Save reflection for day 6"},"caller":{"type":"direct"}}],"stop_reason":null,"stop_sequence":null,"usage":{"input_tokens":0,"cache_creation_input_tokens":244,"cache_read_input_tokens":63119,"cache_creation":{"ephemeral_5m_input_tokens":244,"ephemeral_1h_input_tokens":0},"output_tokens":493,"service_tier":"standard"}},"requestId":"req_011CWKhGfBhTdpARgtgjqCnb","type":"assistant","uuid":"e40fd5e0-37bc-4163-8bff-187f72ad3db4","timestamp":"2025-12-21T10:44:17.535Z"}

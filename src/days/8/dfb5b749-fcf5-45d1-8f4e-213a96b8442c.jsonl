Through careful rigging, they have suspended a\nlarge number of small electrical junction boxes.\n\nTheir plan is to connect the junction boxes with long strings of lights. Most of\nthe junction boxes don't provide electricity; however, when two junction boxes\nare connected by a string of lights, electricity can pass between those two\njunction boxes.\n\nThe Elves are trying to figure out which junction boxes to connect so that\nelectricity can reach every junction box. They even have a list of all of the\njunction boxes' positions in 3D space (your puzzle input).\n\nFor example:\n\n162,817,812\n57,618,57\n906,360,560\n592,479,940\n352,342,300\n466,668,158\n542,29,236\n431,825,988\n739,650,466\n52,470,668\n216,146,977\n819,987,18\n117,168,530\n805,96,715\n346,949,466\n970,615,88\n941,993,340\n862,61,35\n984,92,344\n425,690,689\n\nThis list describes the position of 20 junction boxes, one per line. Each\nposition is given as X,Y,Z coordinates. So, the first junction box in the list\nis at X=162, Y=817, Z=812.\n\nTo save on string lights, the Elves would like to focus on connecting pairs of\njunction boxes that are as close together as possible according to straight-line\ndistance. In this example, the two junction boxes which are closest together are\n162,817,812 and 425,690,689.\n\nBy connecting these two junction boxes together, because electricity can flow\nbetween them, they become part of the same circuit. After connecting them, there\nis a single circuit which contains two junction boxes, and the remaining 18\njunction boxes remain in their own individual circuits.\n\nNow, the two junction boxes which are closest together but aren't already\ndirectly connected are 162,817,812 and 431,825,988. After connecting them, since\n162,817,812 is already connected to another junction box, there is now a single\ncircuit which contains three junction boxes and an additional 17 circuits which\ncontain one junction box each.\n\nThe next two junction boxes to connect are 906,360,560 and 805,96,715. After\nconnecting them, there is a circuit containing 3 junction boxes, a circuit\ncontaining 2 junction boxes, and 15 circuits which contain one junction box\neach.\n\nThe next two junction boxes are 431,825,988 and 425,690,689. Because these two\njunction boxes were already in the same circuit, nothing happens!\n\nThis process continues for a while, and the Elves are concerned that they don't\nhave enough extension cables for all these circuits. They would like to know how\nbig the circuits will be.\n\nAfter making the ten shortest connections, there are 11 circuits: one circuit\nwhich contains 5 junction boxes, one circuit which contains 4 junction boxes,\ntwo circuits which contain 2 junction boxes each, and seven circuits which each\ncontain a single junction box. Multiplying together the sizes of the three\nlargest circuits (5, 4, and one of the circuits of size 2) produces 40.\n\nYour list contains many junction boxes; connect together the 1000 pairs of\njunction boxes which are closest together. Afterward, what do you get if you\nmultiply together the sizes of the three largest circuits?\n"},"caller":{"type":"direct"}}],"stop_reason":"tool_use","stop_sequence":null,"usage":{"input_tokens":0,"cache_creation_input_tokens":13300,"cache_read_input_tokens":27299,"cache_creation":{"ephemeral_5m_input_tokens":13300,"ephemeral_1h_input_tokens":0},"output_tokens":1242,"service_tier":"standard"}},"requestId":"req_011CWHrGRBsSqSPTx3Y9b89f","type":"assistant","uuid":"1d5312de-a94b-4dfe-8f25-7ad1470f056d","timestamp":"2025-12-20T11:21:22.013Z"}

Most of\nthe junction boxes don't provide electricity; however, when two junction boxes\nare connected by a string of lights, electricity can pass between those two\njunction boxes.\n\nThe Elves are trying to figure out which junction boxes to connect so that\nelectricity can reach every junction box. They even have a list of all of the\njunction boxes' positions in 3D space (your puzzle input).\n\nFor example:\n\n162,817,812\n57,618,57\n906,360,560\n592,479,940\n352,342,300\n466,668,158\n542,29,236\n431,825,988\n739,650,466\n52,470,668\n216,146,977\n819,987,18\n117,168,530\n805,96,715\n346,949,466\n970,615,88\n941,993,340\n862,61,35\n984,92,344\n425,690,689\n\nThis list describes the position of 20 junction boxes, one per line. Each\nposition is given as X,Y,Z coordinates. So, the first junction box in the list\nis at X=162, Y=817, Z=812.\n\nTo save on string lights, the Elves would like to focus on connecting pairs of\njunction boxes that are as close together as possible according to straight-line\ndistance. In this example, the two junction boxes which are closest together are\n162,817,812 and 425,690,689.\n\nBy connecting these two junction boxes together, because electricity can flow\nbetween them, they become part of the same circuit. After connecting them, there\nis a single circuit which contains two junction boxes, and the remaining 18\njunction boxes remain in their own individual circuits.\n\nNow, the two junction boxes which are closest together but aren't already\ndirectly connected are 162,817,812 and 431,825,988. After connecting them, since\n162,817,812 is already connected to another junction box, there is now a single\ncircuit which contains three junction boxes and an additional 17 circuits which\ncontain one junction box each.\n\nThe next two junction boxes to connect are 906,360,560 and 805,96,715. After\nconnecting them, there is a circuit containing 3 junction boxes, a circuit\ncontaining 2 junction boxes, and 15 circuits which contain one junction box\neach.\n\nThe next two junction boxes are 431,825,988 and 425,690,689. Because these two\njunction boxes were already in the same circuit, nothing happens!\n\nThis process continues for a while, and the Elves are concerned that they don't\nhave enough extension cables for all these circuits. They would like to know how\nbig the circuits will be.\n\nAfter making the ten shortest connections, there are 11 circuits: one circuit\nwhich contains 5 junction boxes, one circuit which contains 4 junction boxes,\ntwo circuits which contain 2 junction boxes each, and seven circuits which each\ncontain a single junction box. Multiplying together the sizes of the three\nlargest circuits (5, 4, and one of the circuits of size 2) produces 40.\n\nYour list contains many junction boxes; connect together the 1000 pairs of\njunction boxes which are closest together. Afterward, what do you get if you\nmultiply together the sizes of the three largest circuits?\n\n\n--- Part Two ---\n\nThe Elves were right; they definitely don't have enough extension cables. You'll\nneed to keep connecting junction boxes together until they're all in one large\ncircuit.\n\nContinuing the above example, the first connection which causes all of the\njunction boxes to form a single circuit is between the junction boxes at\n216,146,977 and 117,168,530. The Elves need to know how far those junction boxes\nare from the wall so they can pick the right extension cable; multiplying the X\ncoordinates of those two junction boxes (216 and 117) produces 25272.\n\nContinue connecting the closest unconnected pairs of junction boxes together\nuntil they're all in the same circuit. What do you get if you multiply together\nthe X coordinates of the last two junction boxes you need to connect?\n\n\n\nAt this point, all that is left is for you to admire your Advent calendar.\n\nIf you still want to see it, you can get your puzzle input.\n\nYou can also [Shareon Bluesky Twitter Mastodon] this puzzle.\n[INFO  aoc] 🎄 aoc-cli - Advent of Code command-line tool","is_error":false}]},"uuid":"81b15692-f585-4330-8201-50e00603cb04","timestamp":"2025-12-20T11:24:29.493Z","toolUseResult":{"stdout":"--- Day 8: Playground ---\n\nEquipped with a new understanding of teleporter maintenance, you confidently\nstep onto the repaired teleporter pad.\n\nYou rematerialize on an unfamiliar teleporter pad and find yourself in a vast\nunderground space which contains a giant playground!\n\nAcross the playground, a group of Elves are working on setting up an ambitious\nChristmas decoration project.

They would like to know how\nbig the circuits will be.\n\nAfter making the ten shortest connections, there are 11 circuits: one circuit\nwhich contains 5 junction boxes, one circuit which contains 4 junction boxes,\ntwo circuits which contain 2 junction boxes each, and seven circuits which each\ncontain a single junction box. Multiplying together the sizes of the three\nlargest circuits (5, 4, and one of the circuits of size 2) produces 40.\n\nYour list contains many junction boxes; connect together the 1000 pairs of\njunction boxes which are closest together. Afterward, what do you get if you\nmultiply together the sizes of the three largest circuits?\n\n\n--- Part Two ---\n\nThe Elves were right; they definitely don't have enough extension cables. You'll\nneed to keep connecting junction boxes together until they're all in one large\ncircuit.\n\nContinuing the above example, the first connection which causes all of the\njunction boxes to form a single circuit is between the junction boxes at\n216,146,977 and 117,168,530. The Elves need to know how far those junction boxes\nare from the wall so they can pick the right extension cable; multiplying the X\ncoordinates of those two junction boxes (216 and 117) produces 25272.\n\nContinue connecting the closest unconnected pairs of junction boxes together\nuntil they're all in the same circuit. What do you get if you multiply together\nthe X coordinates of the last two junction boxes you need to connect?\n\n\n\nAt this point, all that is left is for you to admire your Advent calendar.\n\nIf you still want to see it, you can get your puzzle input.\n\nYou can also [Shareon Bluesky Twitter Mastodon] this puzzle.\n[INFO  aoc] 🎄 aoc-cli - Advent of Code command-line tool","stderr":"","interrupted":false,"isImage":false}}

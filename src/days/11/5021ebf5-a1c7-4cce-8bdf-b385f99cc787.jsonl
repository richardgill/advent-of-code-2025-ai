Inside, you find several large electrical conduits\nand a ladder.\n\nClimbing down the ladder, you discover the source of the beeping: a large,\ntoroidal reactor which powers the factory above. Some Elves here are hurriedly\nrunning between the reactor and a nearby server rack, apparently trying to fix\nsomething.\n\nOne of the Elves notices you and rushes over. \"It's a good thing you're here! We\njust installed a new server rack, but we aren't having any luck getting the\nreactor to communicate with it!\" You glance around the room and see a tangle of\ncables and devices running from the server rack to the reactor. She rushes off,\nreturning a moment later with a list of the devices and their outputs (your\npuzzle input).\n\nFor example:\n\naaa: you hhh\nyou: bbb ccc\nbbb: ddd eee\nccc: ddd eee fff\nddd: ggg\neee: out\nfff: out\nggg: out\nhhh: ccc fff iii\niii: out\n\nEach line gives the name of a device followed by a list of the devices to which\nits outputs are attached. So, bbb: ddd eee means that device bbb has two\noutputs, one leading to device ddd and the other leading to device eee.\n\nThe Elves are pretty sure that the issue isn't due to any specific device, but\nrather that the issue is triggered by data following some specific path through\nthe devices. Data only ever flows from a device through its outputs; it can't\nflow backwards.\n\nAfter dividing up the work, the Elves would like you to focus on the devices\nstarting with the one next to you (an Elf hastily attaches a label which just\nsays you) and ending with the main output to the reactor (which is the device\nwith the label out).\n\nTo help the Elves figure out which path is causing the issue, they need you to\nfind every path from you to out.\n\nIn this example, these are all of the paths from you to out:\n\nData could take the connection from you to bbb, then from bbb to ddd, then from\nddd to ggg, then from ggg to out.\nData could take the connection to bbb, then to eee, then to out.\nData could go to ccc, then ddd, then ggg, then out.\nData could go to ccc, then eee, then out.\nData could go to ccc, then fff, then out.\n\nIn total, there are 5 different paths leading from you to out.\n\nHow many different paths lead from you to out?\n\n\n--- Part Two ---\n\nThanks in part to your analysis, the Elves have figured out a little bit about\nthe issue. They now know that the problematic data path passes through both dac\n(a digital-to-analog converter) and fft (a device which performs a fast Fourier\ntransform).\n\nThey're still not sure which specific path is the problem, and so they now need\nyou to find every path from svr (the server rack) to out. However, the paths you\nfind must all also visit both dac and fft (in any order).\n\nFor example:\n\nsvr: aaa bbb\naaa: fft\nfft: ccc\nbbb: tty\ntty: ccc\nccc: ddd eee\nddd: hub\nhub: fff\neee: dac\ndac: fff\nfff: ggg hhh\nggg: out\nhhh: out\n\nThis new list of devices contains many paths from svr to out:\n\nsvr,aaa,fft,ccc,ddd,hub,fff,ggg,out\nsvr,aaa,fft,ccc,ddd,hub,fff,hhh,out\nsvr,aaa,fft,ccc,eee,dac,fff,ggg,out\nsvr,aaa,fft,ccc,eee,dac,fff,hhh,out\nsvr,bbb,tty,ccc,ddd,hub,fff,ggg,out\nsvr,bbb,tty,ccc,ddd,hub,fff,hhh,out\nsvr,bbb,tty,ccc,eee,dac,fff,ggg,out\nsvr,bbb,tty,ccc,eee,dac,fff,hhh,out\n\nHowever, only 2 paths from svr to out visit both dac and fft.\n\nFind all of the paths that lead from svr to out. How many of those paths visit\nboth dac and fft?\n\n\n\nAt this point, all that is left is for you to admire your Advent calendar.\n\nIf you still want to see it, you can get your puzzle input.\n\nYou can also [Shareon Bluesky Twitter Mastodon] this puzzle.\n[INFO  aoc] 🎄 aoc-cli - Advent of Code command-line tool","is_error":false}]},"uuid":"ba753d6f-c605-4a89-961e-deaf8dc11f99","timestamp":"2025-12-20T12:11:20.495Z","toolUseResult":{"stdout":"--- Day 11: Reactor ---\n\nYou hear some loud beeping coming from a hatch in the floor of the factory, so\nyou decide to check it out. Inside, you find several large electrical conduits\nand a ladder.\n\nClimbing down the ladder, you discover the source of the beeping: a large,\ntoroidal reactor which powers the factory above. Some Elves here are hurriedly\nrunning between the reactor and a nearby server rack, apparently trying to fix\nsomething.\n\nOne of the Elves notices you and rushes over. \"It's a good thing you're here! We\njust installed a new server rack, but we aren't having any luck getting the\nreactor to communicate with it!\" You glance around the room and see a tangle of\ncables and devices running from the server rack to the reactor. She rushes off,\nreturning a moment later with a list of the devices and their outputs (your\npuzzle input).\n\nFor example:\n\naaa: you hhh\nyou: bbb ccc\nbbb: ddd eee\nccc: ddd eee fff\nddd: ggg\neee: out\nfff: out\nggg: out\nhhh: ccc fff iii\niii: out\n\nEach line gives the name of a device followed by a list of the devices to which\nits outputs are attached. So, bbb: ddd eee means that device bbb has two\noutputs, one leading to device ddd and the other leading to device eee.\n\nThe Elves are pretty sure that the issue isn't due to any specific device, but\nrather that the issue is triggered by data following some specific path through\nthe devices. Data only ever flows from a device through its outputs; it can't\nflow backwards.\n\nAfter dividing up the work, the Elves would like you to focus on the devices\nstarting with the one next to you (an Elf hastily attaches a label which just\nsays you) and ending with the main output to the reactor (which is the device\nwith the label out).\n\nTo help the Elves figure out which path is causing the issue, they need you to\nfind every path from you to out.\n\nIn this example, these are all of the paths from you to out:\n\nData could take the connection from you to bbb, then from bbb to ddd, then from\nddd to ggg, then from ggg to out.\nData could take the connection to bbb, then to eee, then to out.\nData could go to ccc, then ddd, then ggg, then out.\nData could go to ccc, then eee, then out.\nData could go to ccc, then fff, then out.\n\nIn total, there are 5 different paths leading from you to out.\n\nHow many different paths lead from you to out?\n\n\n--- Part Two ---\n\nThanks in part to your analysis, the Elves have figured out a little bit about\nthe issue. They now know that the problematic data path passes through both dac\n(a digital-to-analog converter) and fft (a device which performs a fast Fourier\ntransform).\n\nThey're still not sure which specific path is the problem, and so they now need\nyou to find every path from svr (the server rack) to out. However, the paths you\nfind must all also visit both dac and fft (in any order).\n\nFor example:\n\nsvr: aaa bbb\naaa: fft\nfft: ccc\nbbb: tty\ntty: ccc\nccc: ddd eee\nddd: hub\nhub: fff\neee: dac\ndac: fff\nfff: ggg hhh\nggg: out\nhhh: out\n\nThis new list of devices contains many paths from svr to out:\n\nsvr,aaa,fft,ccc,ddd,hub,fff,ggg,out\nsvr,aaa,fft,ccc,ddd,hub,fff,hhh,out\nsvr,aaa,fft,ccc,eee,dac,fff,ggg,out\nsvr,aaa,fft,ccc,eee,dac,fff,hhh,out\nsvr,bbb,tty,ccc,ddd,hub,fff,ggg,out\nsvr,bbb,tty,ccc,ddd,hub,fff,hhh,out\nsvr,bbb,tty,ccc,eee,dac,fff,ggg,out\nsvr,bbb,tty,ccc,eee,dac,fff,hhh,out\n\nHowever, only 2 paths from svr to out visit both dac and fft.\n\nFind all of the paths that lead from svr to out. How many of those paths visit\nboth dac and fft?\n\n\n\nAt this point, all that is left is for you to admire your Advent calendar.\n\nIf you still want to see it, you can get your puzzle input.\n\nYou can also [Shareon Bluesky Twitter Mastodon] this puzzle.\n[INFO  aoc] 🎄 aoc-cli - Advent of Code command-line tool","stderr":"","interrupted":false,"isImage":false}}

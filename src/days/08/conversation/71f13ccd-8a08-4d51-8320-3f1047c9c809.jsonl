Sort edges by weight, then greedily add edges that connect different components using Union-Find.\n\n2. **Union-Find / Disjoint Set Union (DSU)** - A classic data structure problem. Used in many graph connectivity problems including:\n   - Connected components counting\n   - Cycle detection in undirected graphs\n   - Network connectivity problems\n\n3. **3D Point Distance Problems** - Similar to clustering problems and spatial data structure problems (k-d trees, though not needed here due to small input size).\n\n4. **Advent of Code 2023 Day 25** - Graph connectivity problem requiring finding minimum cuts. Similar in that it deals with graph components.\n\n### Problem Classification\n\nThis problem belongs to the class of **graph connectivity / MST problems**:\n- Part 1: Partial MST construction - stop after K edges, compute product of 3 largest component sizes\n- Part 2: Complete MST construction - find the final edge that connects all components into one\n\n### Solution Approach\n\n**Part 1**: \n1. Parse 3D points\n2. Generate all pairs with their squared Euclidean distances (O(n²))\n3. Sort pairs by distance\n4. Use Union-Find to connect the first 1000 pairs\n5. Count component sizes and multiply the 3 largest\n\n**Part 2**:\n1. Same setup as Part 1\n2. Track component count in Union-Find\n3. Keep connecting until componentCount == 1\n4. Return product of X coordinates of the final connecting edge\n\nThe key insight was recognizing this as Kruskal's algorithm. Using Int32Array for the Union-Find parent/rank arrays provides type safety with TypeScript's noUncheckedIndexedAccess while also being more memory efficient. The squared distance comparison avoids sqrt() calls since we only need relative ordering.\"","description":"Save reflection for day 8"},"caller":{"type":"direct"}}],"stop_reason":"tool_use","stop_sequence":null,"usage":{"input_tokens":0,"cache_creation_input_tokens":223,"cache_read_input_tokens":81540,"cache_creation":{"ephemeral_5m_input_tokens":223,"ephemeral_1h_input_tokens":0},"output_tokens":552,"service_tier":"standard"}},"requestId":"req_011CWKiUV4wUxb3pUQzWt55c","type":"assistant","uuid":"8b991122-9c77-4d10-960b-e9f9e3405110","timestamp":"2025-12-21T11:00:07.281Z"}

## Runtime

Use Bun instead of Node.js.

- `bun <file>` to run a file
- Run `bun local-ci` to run lint, tsc and tests

Part 1 and part 2 solutions are in separate folders (e.g., `src/days/01.1/`, `src/days/01.2/`).

## Solving

Use `/solve-day` or `/solve-part` commands. Create example1.txt/example2.txt from the problem's examples.

Be persistent and solve problems autonomously. If a solution doesn't work, keep trying different approaches. Debug failures, fix errors, and iterate until solved.
